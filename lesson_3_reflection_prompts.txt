When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Using a remote repository would be a great place for collaboration. Whereas keeping it local, would make collaboration difficult.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may be sitting at a different computer where your changes aren't saved locally. So, somework would have to be done via GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are exclusive to GitHub. They are clones that happen between the GitHub server environments.

Clones are copies for repositories. They are done on locally.

Branches are likely done locally as a way to experiment or potentially add features to the master branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It allows you to look at the changes from the remote locally. So if you're going to be offline, you can still see changes locally of that made in the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I could create a web server with git installed and ssh into. However the setup would take time which is a more difficult learning curve. Since GitHub is ubiquitious to a software developer's toolset, it would be easier to go this route.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

It allows for features or changes to be created without affecting the master branch.
