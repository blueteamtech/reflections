When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Using a remote repository would be a great place for collaboration. Whereas keeping it local, would make collaboration difficult.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may be sitting at a different computer where your changes aren't saved locally. So, somework would have to be done via GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are exclusive to GitHub. They are clones that happen between the GitHub server environments.

Clones are copies for repositories. They are done on locally.

Branches are likely done locally as a way to experiment or potentially add features to the master branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
